This is a Raspberry Pi project that uses a pair of PIR motion sensors to switch on a relay which controls a string of LED lights to illiminate a flight of stairs for a period of time.

So far there is a SysVinit script included and the actual python script.
NOTE: You may need to enable i2c module support on your Pi before starting (https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-4-gpio-setup/configuring-i2c)
